# FFXIV_housing_bot
This is a discord bot that keeps track of housing availability. 

I don't know how README.md works.

To use this bot you need to create a Discord bot, see: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/

I chose to have this bot react to ## +  a command, you can change this on line 61:
>bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='##', description=description) 
change the command_prefix setting to change the reactive prefix.

What else do you want to know?
