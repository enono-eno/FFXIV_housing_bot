"""
Information:
This bot was made by Enono Eno to assist with FFXIV housing tracking.
Commands:
    open, list, forsale
        These add the plot following the command to the database and issue a user group alert
        ex: input: ##open mist ward 12 plot 5
            output: mist ward 12 plot 5 is set to Available: 1, and the time of listing is recorded.
            in channel: @SmallMist, a small plot has opened. Mist, Ward 12, Plot 5. Prime time will be at 5pm EST.
    close, unlist, sold, sell
        These remove the plot following the command to the database and mark the original callout as 'sold'
        ex: input: ##unlist mist ward 12 plot 5
            output: mist ward 12 plot 5 is set to Available: 0, and the time of listing is removed. An emoji is added to the original listing.
            in channel: @SmallMist, <st>a small plot has opened. Mist, Ward 12, Plot 5. Prime time will be at 5pm EST.</st> was sold.
    sweep, report
        This scans the database for open plots and returns a report on the currently available plots and their anticipated primetimes.
        ex: input: ##report
        output: scans all plots for openings...
        in channel: [1] Plots available... [1] Goblet, [S] 01-24 <12pm> 
        or whatever...
